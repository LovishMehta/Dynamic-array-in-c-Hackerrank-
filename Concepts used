Concept of Dynamic memory allocation is used

whenever you are using "pointer" for the purpose of "Array", keep in mind

CASE I: FOR 1-D array

For 1-D array, we use single pointer " *p ", which point to the first address of the array.
Now for *p array ,we have to allocate memory. syntax: p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)).
  p: points to the first location of the array.
  
CASE II: For 2-D array

For 2-D array, we use double pointer " **P ", which points to the first row and column (0,0) of 2D array.
Now for **p array ,  we have to allocate memory. SYNTAX p = (int**)malloc(sizeof(int*)) //allocate memory to array of arrays.
                                                        p[i] = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int))// allocate memory to array.
